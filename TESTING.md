# TESTING

## Validation and Linting 

### HTML

[W3C - HTML](https://validator.w3.org/)

The website was run through the validator by URL instead of file to avoid issues with Django's variables and extends used in its templates.

Any of the pages which required login could not be checked by URI, so I pasted the test into the validator instead. These pages include the add_product and edit_product pages

Please find all HTML validation screenshots [here.](/documentation/HTML-VALIDATION.md)

### CSS

[Jigsaw - CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

The website only has two CSS files being served on the html page. One of the great benefits I find with sass is the fact that while editing you can break down the file structure for your styles how ever you like. Then when it is time for the page to be served it is only a hand ful of pages. The error in the style.css file is due to the psudo-selector ::-web-kit-outer-spin. Unfortunately this was the only way for me to create the desired effect and upon a quick search about the issue I found that is isn't harmful towards performance.

The second file is a custom package of bootstrap styles made available by using SASS. This is one of the main reasons why I wanted to use SASS. I have found bootstrap to be a bit bloated and have at multiple points found myself having to overwrite some of their styles using "!important" beside values. This practice allows me to just use the bootstrap styles I want like the grid and spacing classes.

I have included them here in this TESTING file as there is only Two.

### JavaScript

[JSHint - JS](https://jshint.com/)

The website features 4 JS files. 

stripe.js is used to control the payment conformation before an order is processed. It is also used to instantiate a card payment module on the checkout page

change-qty.js is a small file used to affect the amount of a number inputs value. Giving the user the option to increment the amount using the mouse instead of typing in the number.

scroll_animations.js controls the movement and animations in the nav bar. It also controls the messages div to let the user know when an action was unsuccessful or not.

home_animations.js controls the few animations found on the home page. I have always been told you have to make the most of when you get someones attention, as you don't know how long you will have it for. So I tried to put a little extra care into making the homepage eye catching.

home_animations.js has a warning for unidentified variables but they are defined and also used in the function, so I am not too sure what the issue is there.

All other files passed through JSHint completely clean.

I have included them here is this TESTING file for convenience.

### Python 

[CI Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)

I did not Lint any files that had 0 changes to them after they were generated by Django. This includes some admin.py files etc.

All custom files were passed through Code Institutes liniting app and all were returned as PEP8 compliant. 

You can find Screenshots of all validation [Here.](/documentation/PEP8-VALIDATION.md)
